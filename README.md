## Introduction

This is my slot machine browser game. hitting the _LET IT RIDE_ button will generate three random values between 0 and 2. If the values match the player's wallet will increase by one and a "You Win!" message will be dispayed. 

If the values do not match the player's wallet value will decrease by one and a "Sorry Loser" message will be displayed. If the player's wallet reaches zero a "Game Over" message will be displayed and the game ends.

## Technologies Used:
1. JavaScript
2. HTML
3. CSS

## Getting Started:

To play, go [here](https://cbkehoe.github.io/Slot_Machine/) and hit the _LET IT RIDE_ button to start playing.

## Next Steps

In the future I plan to add additional features including:

1. Animations of the values cycling in each slot to simulate spinning slots.

2. Sound effects to accompany the spin animations to further imitate real-life slot machines. 

3. A function to place a "bet" of the amount of their choosing which increases or decreases the wallet value by the amount placed. 

4. Replacing the button with a 'lever' in the form of a scroll bar which fires the function when the scroll reaches the bottom
